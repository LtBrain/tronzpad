# **TRONZPAD**
**TRONZPAD** is a 12 key + 1 encoder macropad that has 12 individually addressable LEDs to provide underglow/backlighting.  
It was developed for an entry for **Hackclub Highway**'s YSWS project (Hackpad) and has the ability to perform **macros** and other  
cool stuff with VIAL & QMK.
